# Algae Growth Tracker

## Project Overview
Algae Growth Tracker is a web application designed to monitor and optimize the growth conditions of Spirulina algae. By tracking essential parameters such as temperature, light intensity, pH level, and CO₂ injection duration, users can ensure optimal growth conditions for their algae cultivation. The application provides real-time monitoring, data visualization, and historical data logging.

## Installation
To set up the Algae Growth Tracker on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/algae-growth-tracker.git
   cd algae-growth-tracker
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. No additional installations are required since it is a static web application.

## Usage
- **Home**: View the introduction and navigate to other sections.
- **Dashboard**: Monitor growth parameters in real-time using various charts and cards displaying live data.
- **Settings**: Configure growth parameters such as temperature limits, light intensity, duration, and pH level.
- **History**: Access historical data logs of monitored parameters, with options to export data in CSV format.
- **About**: Read more about the application and its features.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature, light intensity, and pH level.
- Dynamic charts visualizing growth parameter trends.
- User-friendly settings to configure optimal growth parameters.
- Historical data logging with the option to export as CSV for external analysis.
